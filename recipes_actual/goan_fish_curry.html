        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          This fish curry comes to you by way of Goa, a little pocket of Indian
          paradise that's all about the sun, surf, sand and excellent seafood!
          With a deeply aromatic tomato and coconut based sauce, Goan Fish Curry
          calls for a good handful of spices but once you start cooking, it's
          done in 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of all the region's dishes, along with Vindaloo perhaps one of the
          most well known is Goan Fish Curry. Pronounced go-an (as opposed to
          “groan” without the “r”!), it's an aromatic curry with a blend of
          spices, garlic, ginger and onion along with fresh tomato and coconut.
          And unlike other popular Indian curries, such as everybody's favourite
          Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala, Goan Fish Curry has a touch of tang
          to it which cuts through the richness of the sauce.

          <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Curry Paste First:</strong>put it all in a jug that the
              blender stick fits into (I hope you’ve still got the milkshake
              container yours came with!) then blitz away. Use water to help it
              blitz – otherwise it’s too dry;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blitz until the onion is puree:</strong> it won’t take
              much longer than 10 seconds, there’s nothing hard in this curry
              paste;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook off the curry paste:</strong> this is to make the
              spice flavours bloom and cook the onion, garlic and ginger. Also,
              to cook out the water that we added to help the paste puree;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook off the tomato paste: </strong>next, we add the
              tomato paste and tomato pulp/puree, and cook that down to as well
              to get rid of excess water;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add coconut milk</strong> and remaining sauce ingredients
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simmer for 5 minutes </strong>to reduce and bring the
              flavours together
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add fish </strong>in the last few minutes – it only takes
              3 to 4 minutes to cook;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Garnish </strong>with fresh coriander and green chillies,
              then serve over basmati rice!
            </li>
          </ol>

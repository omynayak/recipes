    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Ask any pastry chef or chocolatier and they will tell you that chocolate’s
      worst enemy is water. Even a tiny drop accidentally landing in a bowl of
      tempering chocolate can clump up the sugar and cocoa particles within
      moments. What’s meant to be a smooth and shiny mixture turns gritty and
      grainy, which means scrapping and starting all over again. This
      incompatibility is almost universal. Almost, except in the world of French
      chemist Hervé This, who turns the cardinal rule of chocolate on its head
      with a recipe he calls Chantilly chocolate.

      While traditional mousses require egg yolks or heavy cream to develop
      their rich, velvety texture, This’s version, as featured in his 2002 book
      Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor, relies on a trick
      of science. He combines two seemingly disparate ingredients—chocolate and
      water—to create a mousse of astonishingly airy and silky texture. This
      technique has influenced chefs like Heston Blumenthal and writers like
      Kristen Miglore, who featured the mousse in her Food52 column, Genius
      Recipes.

      </li>
      <li>Boil 3/4 cup of water and pour it over the chocolate.</li>
      <li>Quickly stir until the chocolate is melted.</li>
      <li>Set the bowl with melted chocolate inside a slightly larger bowl filled with ice water.</li>
